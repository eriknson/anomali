            Hi and welcome. <br />
            <strong>We are two engineering students doing our Master Thesis.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            For 20 weeks, we have had the honor to explore public transport data as a part of KoDa (the Swedish Public
            Transport Data Lab) which aims to provide open data in real-time format along with historical data and
            annotated data sets for applications related to public transport.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have decided to look closer at anomalies in time schedule times for the UL network in order to build a
            data-driven model describing how vulnerable different partsâ€™ of the network are in this regard.{' '}
